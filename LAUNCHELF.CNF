# File name:    LAUNCHELF.CNF           Revision Date: 2006.03.28
# Created by:   Ronald Andersson        Creation Date: 2006.02.02
# Purpose:      Define new format and defaults for LaunchELF CNF files,
#               to serve as a guide in developing the code implementing
#               these changes.
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Note that LaunchELF v3.41t (or later) will accept this file as-is when
# loading CNF, but if you modify any settings so that LaunchELF saves
# the file again, then all comments will be removed.
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
CNF_version = 2.0
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# The CNF_version variable MUST exist for a CNF to be accepted as valid,
# and it must also be the first variable defined in the file. That way
# an old CNF can't cause damage when read by new LaunchELF versions.
# Future LaunchELF versions may also check the value for some features.
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Next follows the 12 (as yet) launching links, here kept in traditional
# order, though users are allowed to vary the order at will. For these
# 12 variables the following name conventions apply:
#
# "LK_" is an abbreviation for "Launch Key" and is used as a prefix for
# the key descriptor (eg: "Square"). That is then followed by the suffix
# "_E1" which is an abbreviation for "Execution Method 1". At present
# that is the only method we have, but hopefully that will change...
#
# The default value for most of these should be an empty string, except
# that one link should start the file browser, so people can start to
# copy stuff without having to make a new CNF.
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
LK_auto_E1     =
LK_Circle_E1   = MISC/FileBrowser
LK_Cross_E1    =
LK_Square_E1   =
LK_Triangle_E1 =
LK_L1_E1       =
LK_R1_E1       =
LK_L2_E1       =
LK_R2_E1       =
LK_L3_E1       =
LK_R3_E1       =
LK_Start_E1    =
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# After the launch key definitions we have the variables for diverse
# settings, most of which use obvious naming schemes and have their
# traditional default values. Some exceptions are the variables for
# GUI colour values, which are described in the next section.
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
LK_auto_Timer   = 10
Menu_Hide_Paths = 1
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Next we have the GUI colour values, for which I made some choices that
# differ widely from all the other variables so far. First and foremost,
# I switched their data format to pure hex, to make it practical for a
# human to edit the byte values. I also added a suffix to the names,
# so the user has a mnemonic key to the usage of the byte values.
# And finally, I chose some new default values that I've been working on
# for a while. The effects of these settings are as follows:
#
# Normal text is fully black, while the background is half-level white.
# Border, submenus, and LaunchELF title text use a medium grey colour,
# with half the brightness of the background, while alerts and progress
# messages use a clear but subdued red colour.
#
# My goal with these defaults was to achieve max clarity with no glare,
# and I think this succeeded fairly well, though the final results do
# depend greatly on your monitor settings as well.
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
GUI_Col_1_ABGR = 00808080
GUI_Col_2_ABGR = 00404040

GUI_Col_4_ABGR = 00000000
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Screen_X  = 128
Screen_Y  = 30
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Note that I have changed the default for IOP reset, as this has been
# long-term tested now, and proven superior to starting without it.
# I have also changed the default for CDVD checking, as the old default
# could cause lockup on some PS2 models if started with empty tray.
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Init_CDVD_Check  = 0
Screen_Interlace = 0
Init_Reset_IOP   = 1

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# The variables below have been added after the original design (v3.41t)
# of the new CNF format. They should be used as follows:
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# USBD_FILE is valid in v3.41u and later versions. It's used to choose
# an alternate USBD.IRX file, which LaunchELF will then use instead of
# the embedded one. You can set it in the 'STARTUP SETTINGS' screen.
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
USBD_FILE =
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# NET_HOSTwrite is valid in v3.44 and later versions. It can enable
# the ability of the networked HOST interface to write on your PC HDDs!
# Users who want to avoid risks for their PC should leave it as default,
# which disables these new abilities. For safety reasons it can only be
# changed by direct user editing. Edit it to a non-zero value to enable
# the new abilities. (You'll need a very new ps2client.exe as well.)
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
NET_HOSTwrite = 0
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#SKIN_FILE is used to select a JPG file that will be used as background
#for the LaunchELF screen. Its value should be the full JPG pathname.
#The default value is an empty string, meaning that the colour set by
#GUI_Col_1_ABGR above will be used for screen background instead.
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
SKIN_FILE =
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#Menu_Title is a string that will be displayed at the top left of the
#screen. Its main purpose is to allow users to have different titles
#for different config pages. It is editable in "STARTUP SETTINGS".
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Menu_Title =
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# End of file: LAUNCHELF.CNF
