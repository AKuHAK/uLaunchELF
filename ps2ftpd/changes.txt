Unofficial ps2ftpd.irx module by EP

FtpClient.c
-Changed string format to "MMM DD YYYY" format, which is based on "FTP LIST Specification". (NOTE: fixes the Unknown list format errors with most ftp clients).
-Added the possibility to change within the included sources the option for changing to "MMM DD hh:mm" format. (NOTE: read the comments in the included source file).

FileSystem.c
-Added a check in the scan filesystem devices function that hides all except "mc" and "pfs" directories from the ftp clients. (Note: Now modified to fix bug with some ftp clients)
-Added a fix for multiple mc directories bug, which occurs when both slots contain PS2 memory cards.
-Added "mass" as a supported filesystem device so it shows up with "mc" and "pfs" in the root device listing.
-Changed a few things in order to accommodate support for USB mass fixing a sub directory issue.
-Created a workaround to fix a "mass" listing issue do to timestamps not being able to be accessed. (Note: Hopefully this is only temporary but as of now all files/folders timestamps for "mass" show up as "1/1/1970").
-Added "hdd" as a supported filesystem device so it shows up with "mc", "pfs", and "mass" in the root device listing.
-Changed a few things to support HDD partition viewing by fixing a sub directory issue.
-Made changes to only show the same partitions that unofficial LaunchELF shows.
-Fixed issue where mc save folders, that are copy protected, showed up as files instead of folders.
-Fixed protection attributes not showing up properly with mass.
-Removed workaround for "mass" and timestamp issues since it's no longer needed do to changes to usb_mass driver.

I have included a binary of ps2ftpd in the modules directory for the unofficial LaunchELF with all the changes noted above.

I release my changes to parts of the source in the hopes that the author of ps2ftpd may add my changes to FtpClient.c and some of those from FileSystem.c.

Special Thanks to the following:
Chip for all the hard work on ps2ftpd, which I made minor changes to.
