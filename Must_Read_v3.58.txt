Version v3.58 of uLaunchELF has been heavily modified when it comes to the screen display routines, and it uses a much higher resolution than any previous version. Because of this the old defaults for screen offsets are no longer valid, and will need to be changed if you want to keep using your old CNF files. Just transfer them to your PC, and edit the values of Screen_X and Screen_Y to the new defaults, as follows:

For NTSC consoles:
Screen_X = 158
Screen_Y = 50

For PAL consoles:
Screen_X = 163
Screen_Y = 72

If you don't want to bother with editing the CNFs you can also choose to erase them, as the new defaults will be used automatically if no CNF is found on startup.
