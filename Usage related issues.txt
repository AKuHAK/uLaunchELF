Known runtime problems in v3.52:
--------------------------------
If you have used a background image and want to return to using a simple
background colour instead, then you may need to restart the program, to
get rid of 'remnant' textures. These will normally be visible as remnants
of the old background picture, when popup menus and temporary strings are
displayed. This phenomenon is harmless, except that it may make it hard to
read the text. To recover from such problems simply restart (or reboot)
uLaunchELF after disabling the background image in the "STARTUP SETTINGS"
submenu, and exiting by "RETURN" and "OK", so that the change is saved.
When restarted this way, there will be no more texture remnants.
