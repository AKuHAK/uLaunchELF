Issues with uLaunchELF v3.53

Compiler Warnings:
------------------
With old toolchain and PS2SDK, libito 0.2.1 gave 106 compiler warnings, most
of which were caused by the numerous example files.
With current toolchain and PS2SDK, the libito examples won't compile at all,
but fortunately the lib itself does compile fine (despite a few warnings).

No compiler warnings for the main code of LaunchELF

1 compiler warning for ps2host in net_fsys.c
1 more compiler warning for ps2host if compiling with IOP 3.2.2

NB: IOP 3.2.2 is the current standard, and should be used whenever possible.
