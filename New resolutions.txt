From version v3.58 and on uLaunchELF uses screen display routines that have been heavily modified compared to all previous versions, and now use a much higher resolution than any of them. Because of this the old defaults for screen offsets are no longer valid, and will need to be changed if you want to keep using CNF files from those old versions. Just transfer them to your PC, and edit the values of Screen_X and Screen_Y to the new defaults, as follows:

NTSC with Interlace OFF:
Screen_X = 158
Screen_Y = 26

NTSC with Interlace ON:
Screen_X = 158
Screen_Y = 50

PAL with Interlace OFF:
Screen_X = 163
Screen_Y = 37

PAL with Interlace ON:
Screen_X = 163
Screen_Y = 72

If you don't want to bother with editing the CNFs you can also choose to erase them, as the new defaults will be used automatically if no CNF is found on startup.
NB: That feature didn't work correctly in v3.58, but it does in all later versions.
