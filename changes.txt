Unofficial LaunchELF releases by EP + dlanor

LaunchELF v3.41r (12/25/2005)
ps2ftpd new additions and changes: Included ps2ftpd.irx and source changes.
-Fixed an issue with auto-mounting hdd partitions for those using Internet Explorer as their ftp client.
-Altered files: draw.c=version_id, FileSystem.c=ps2ftpd changes

LaunchELF v3.41q (12/24/2005)
-Updated host and all its source files with EEUG's changes to fix a possible issue with host.
-Made a couple of changes to radad's latest changes to hdd_fio.c in the ps2sdk. (Note: Included hdd_fio.c, which compiles with the older iop-2.8.1 and gives accurate sizes for hdd partitions).
ps2ftpd new additions and changes: Included ps2ftpd.irx and source changes.
-Changed hdd partitions to show up as directories instead of files.
-Added the ability to auto-mount hdd partitions to pfs/0. (Notes: Once a partition's directory is opened, the partition is auto-mounted to pfs/0. The directory is then also changed to pfs/0. Partitions are un-mounted at hdd/0 and also just prior to being auto-mounted).
-Cleaned up the source code a bit to fix an unused variable compiler warning.
-Finished the UNIX-style LIST format after many other changes were made. (Note: Now the LIST format does either "MMM DD  YYYY" or "MMM DD hh:mm" based on the days between calculation).
-Made some slight changes to read the ps2's system clock.
-Added the ability to read the ps2's system clock so now root and device dirs use this instead of "1/1/1970".
-Added a days between dates calculator in order to complete the UNIX-style LIST format. (Note: Now if the modified date of a file/dir is within the last 182 days the "hh:mm" format will appear in place of the "YYYY" format as it's suppose to).
-Commented out all the extra debug printf's as they are currently no longer needed.
-Added a new uitoa function that can deal with larger sizes.
-Fixed an issue with size so now hdd partitions and files can accurately display size in bytes.
-Added issues.txt that lists the only issues left to be resolved with ps2ftpd.
-Altered files: draw.c=version_id, hostlink.h + imports.lst + irx_imports.h + Makefile + net_fio.c + net_fio.h + net_fsys.c + ps2host.c + Rules.make=updated host source files also now diff compatible, FileSystem.c + FileSystem.h + FtpClient.c + imports.lst + irx_imports.h=ps2ftpd changes

LaunchELF v3.41p (11/19/2005)
-Updated "Development related issues.txt" removing the iomanX.irx issue as it has now been fixed at the sdk level.
-Updated the source package removing iomanX things as radad's changes made it into the ps2sdk.
-Updated the makefile to use the iomanX.irx from the sdk.
-Updated the rest of dlanor's ps2sdk source files so they're more diff compatible.
-Updated the source package that fixes an inconsistency with created files/dirs hour timestamp for hdd and usb mass devices.

 improved reliability for the host: interface. All other functionality is unchanged.
NB: Matrix Infinity Dev.2 boot again requires the non-packed ELF for this version.

LaunchELF v3.41d (06/17/2005)
-Fixed bug from v3.41c, causing IOP reset to fail in some cicumstances
 This was fixed by not using initsbv_patches before IOP reset.
 For future updates, we need to be aware of possible conflicts with this.

NB: Those things do not matter for Dev1 booting with the same chip though.
NB: Exploit booting works with either ELF, but seems to dislike IOP reset

LaunchELF v3.41b (06/07/2005)
-Changed to a cycle like function for config loading.
-Renamed newer launch screen menu items to reflect changes to config loading.
-Added new menu, "STARTUP SETTINGS", and moved "RESET IOP" to it.

Note: Defaults are "RESET IOP: OFF", "NUMBER OF CNF'S: 1", and "KEY MAPPING: O:OK X:CANCEL".

LaunchELF v3.41a (05/30/2005)
-Added reset IOP on start as a toggle (Note: off by default).
-Added dlanor's fix for the elf launching bug.
-Changed text info from "AWAY" to "SUBTRACT" in the menus because it's more proper to say add or subtract than add or away.

-Added support for two total configs press d-pad left or right to switch between configs. (Note: the two configs are LAUNCHELF.CNF and LAUNCHELF1.CNF).
-Added two menus below the Select config item - left and right to load configs via menu.

I have included two binaries: BOOT.ELF - the normal binary and BOOTc.ELF - a compressed binary. The compressed binary, BOOT.ELF, was packed using pixel's ps2-packer 0.4.5.

I release my changes to parts of the source in the hopes that the author of LaunchELF may add some or all of my modifications. I have included all the files that I made changes to in the src folder. Also diff's are included as well in the src\diff folder just apply against the source of v3.41 or just use my already modified src files.

I used some other peoples code so if anyone should get credit they should. I also used some other people's ideas, which I'm thankful for.

Special Thanks to the following:
Mr. Mirakichi the author of LaunchELF.
Hermes for early reset IOP source (BOOT.c cogswaploader).
dlanor for the fix of a launch bug, which occurs upon executing an ELF after trying to execute a non-ELF file. Also for all the new additons, fixes, and help.
kthu for the key swapping source changes, which allow the user to swap x and circle buttons.
Slam-Tilt for the NETWORK SETTINGS option source changes.
chip for ps2ftpd, of which a few modifications were made to.
pixel for ps2-packer that made the small BOOTc.ELF.
mrbrown for the independence exploit.
The ps2dev community for the tools and assistance.
all those who like LaunchELF.
