Unofficial LaunchELF releases by EP + dlanor

LaunchELF v3.45  (2006.02.19)
-Fixed a LaunchELF bug that prevented folder overwrites when pasting to HOST.
-Fixed a PS2Client bug that prevented detection of folder conflicts on HOST.
-Added a progress report (written file bytes counter) to 'Paste' and 'mcPaste'.
-EP fixed a few issues that prevented PS1 memory cards from appearing in FTP listing. (Note: Files on PS1 memory cards lack timestamps so the timestamps come from the current PS2 system time).

LaunchELF v3.44  (2006.02.18)
-Implemented HOST interface write access to networked PC. This uses a new CNF variable named "NET_HOSTwrite" which has a default value of "0" meaning it is disabled. For reasons of safety there is no way to change this value from the config menu. Edit it yourself, and set its value to "1" (or any other non-zero value) to enable the new abilities, which include the following menu functions 'Cut', 'Paste', 'mcPaste', 'Delete', 'Rename', 'New Dir'. Note that most of the new functions require a very recent version of ps2client or RadHostClient to function, and at present the 'Rename' function only works with the ps2client version specially patched for LaunchELF. (Available in the LaunchELF forum.) (NB: file writing seems bugged in RadHostClient v1.5)
-Added modified sources for ps2client to the folder "Changed source for external projects".

LaunchELF v3.43  (2006.02.16)
-This release is purely a bugfix for an old bug in the HOST interface. That bug was mostly harmless in older versions, but became capable of freezing the console in v3.41u and v3.42.

LaunchELF v3.42  (2006.02.15) NB: switched date format to YYYY.MM.DD
-Implemented mcPaste command in submenu. Like the old Paste command this copies all selected files and folders (recursively), but it is specially intended for MC backups. It can only be used either to copy from MC to non-MC (making backups from MC) or to copy from non-MC to MC (restoring backups to MC). These backups on non-MC media will have an extra file in each folder, holding the original MC attributes and timestamps of all files in that folder. This data will be used when restoring the backups to MC, so that games will accept the restored files as being the originals. The 'extra' files are filtered out from such copying so they don't appear among the restored files on MC. Those 'extra' files all use the same filename, which is "PS2_MC_Backup_Attributes.BUP.bin" (to avoid any confusion with 'real' files).

LaunchELF v3.41u (02/13/2006)
-Implemented new standards for handling of file and folder attributes on PS2 memory cards. This ensures that all gamesaves copied from one such MC to another such MC will have all attributes and timestamps preserved, so the copies remain acceptable to the games. It also improves the chances of successful backup/restore of gamesaves to/from non-MC devices, by using standard attributes for files and folders that match what the majority of games use.
-Implemented a patch to the 'Get Size' command, so that it will display real attributes and modification timestamp of a file/folder on MC. For non MC this will show a standard attribute and zeroed timestamp, so that's not very useful. This patch is just a temporary thing, until we make something better.
-Implemented selection of external USBD.IRX files, for those that have trouble using the one embedded into LaunchELF. (This change was contributed by 'sincro'.)

LaunchELF v3.41t (02/03/2006)
-Implemented a new CNF format and various new defaults for the settings. Essentially this means that all settings are specified as named variables, and line order is no longer significant. This will allow easy human editing as well as many new features in the future. For details on new defaults, study the enclosed LAUNCHELF.CNF

LaunchELF v3.41s (01/13/2006)
-Modified a comment in fat_write.c to fix an IOP 3.2.2 compiler issue for the usb mass driver.
-Added a new line to the end of imports.lst to eliminate an IOP 3.2.2 compiler warning for host.
-Rebuilt everything with the IOP 3.2.2 compiler. (Note: includes cdvd, ps2ftpd, and usb_mass modules).
-Modified the makefile to use the ps2dev9.irx module from the PS2SDK instead of the older one from the original LaunchELF source package. (Note: Are there still reliability problems?)
-Updated "Development related issues.txt" removing both the ps2dev9.irx reliability issue that now appears fine and the ps2ftpd.irx issue that is now fixed.
ps2ftpd new additions and changes: Included ps2ftpd.irx and source changes.
-Fixed a bug with the IOP 3.2.2 compiler by moving "int iOpened = 0" variable declaration in function FileSystem_OpenFile to the top with the other variable declarations. (Note: this fixes the crashing issue that occurred when transferring a new file to the memory card).
-Rewrote some of the auto-mount partitions code to also work with the IOP 3.2.2 compiler.
-Updated issues.txt removing the issue with the IOP 3.2.2 compiler.
-Altered files: draw.c=version_id, fat_write.c=comment fix, imports.lst=IOP warning fix, makefile=use sdk's ps2dev9 module, FileSystem.c=ps2ftpd changes

LaunchELF v3.41r (12/25/2005)
ps2ftpd new additions and changes: Included ps2ftpd.irx and source changes.
-Fixed an issue with auto-mounting hdd partitions for those using Internet Explorer as their ftp client.
-Altered files: draw.c=version_id, FileSystem.c=ps2ftpd changes

LaunchELF v3.41q (12/24/2005)
-Updated host and all its source files with EEUG's changes to fix a possible issue with host.
-Made a couple of changes to radad's latest changes to hdd_fio.c in the ps2sdk. (Note: Included hdd_fio.c, which compiles with the older iop-2.8.1 and gives accurate sizes for hdd partitions).
ps2ftpd new additions and changes: Included ps2ftpd.irx and source changes.
-Changed hdd partitions to show up as directories instead of files.
-Added the ability to auto-mount hdd partitions to pfs/0. (Notes: Once a partition's directory is opened, the partition is auto-mounted to pfs/0. The directory is then also changed to pfs/0. Partitions are un-mounted at hdd/0 and also just prior to being auto-mounted).
-Cleaned up the source code a bit to fix an unused variable compiler warning.
-Finished the UNIX-style LIST format after many other changes were made. (Note: Now the LIST format does either "MMM DD  YYYY" or "MMM DD hh:mm" based on the days between calculation).
-Made some slight changes to read the ps2's system clock.
-Added the ability to read the ps2's system clock so now root and device dirs use this instead of "1/1/1970".
-Added a days between dates calculator in order to complete the UNIX-style LIST format. (Note: Now if the modified date of a file/dir is within the last 182 days the "hh:mm" format will appear in place of the "YYYY" format as it's suppose to).
-Commented out all the extra debug printf's as they are currently no longer needed.
-Added a new uitoa function that can deal with larger sizes.
-Fixed an issue with size so now hdd partitions and files can accurately display size in bytes.
-Added issues.txt that lists the only issues left to be resolved with ps2ftpd.
-Altered files: draw.c=version_id, hostlink.h + imports.lst + irx_imports.h + Makefile + net_fio.c + net_fio.h + net_fsys.c + ps2host.c + Rules.make=updated host source files also now diff compatible, FileSystem.c + FileSystem.h + FtpClient.c + imports.lst + irx_imports.h=ps2ftpd changes

LaunchELF v3.41p (11/19/2005)
-Updated "Development related issues.txt" removing the iomanX.irx issue as it has now been fixed at the sdk level.
-Updated the source package removing iomanX things as radad's changes made it into the ps2sdk.
-Updated the makefile to use the iomanX.irx from the sdk.
-Updated the rest of dlanor's ps2sdk source files so they're more diff compatible.
-Updated the source package that fixes an inconsistency with created files/dirs hour timestamp for hdd and usb mass devices.
-Changed usb_mass driver slightly to allow the reading of Date/Time Created, Date Accessed, and Date/Time Modified.
ps2ftpd new additions and changes: Included ps2ftpd.irx and source changes.
-Reverted back to the UNIX-style LIST format as it appears to be the most compatible overall.
-Placed printf's in the driver to show timestamps and other attributes for possible future debugging purposes that will hopefully only be temporary.
-Altered files: draw.c=version_id, fat.h + fat_driver.c=support for reading more of usb mass timestamp attributes, fat_write.c + misc.c + misc.c=fixes for hour timestamp issue, makefile + libmc.h + libpad.c + libpad.h + libpad.h + libpadx.c=updates, FileSystem.c + FtpClient.c + FtpCommands.c=ps2ftpd changes

ps2ftpd new additions and changes: Included ps2ftpd.irx and source changes.
-Fixed a bug with MS-style list format and many ftp clients.
-Changed MS-style list format slightly to show 12:00AM instead of 00:00AM, which was wrong earlier. (Note: some ftp clients will get this wrong and show 12:00PM instead so be aware).
-Altered files: draw.c=version_id, FtpClient.c + FtpCommands.c=ps2ftpd changes

LaunchELF v3.41o (11/12/2005)
-Updated iomanX.irx module and source file with radad's changes.

-Changed ps2dev9.irx module from present PS2SDK to an older version, to achieve much
 improved reliability for the host: interface. All other functionality is unchanged.
NB: Matrix Infinity Dev.2 boot again requires the non-packed ELF for this version.

LaunchELF v3.41d (06/17/2005)
-Fixed bug from v3.41c, causing IOP reset to fail in some cicumstances
 This was fixed by not using initsbv_patches before IOP reset.
 For future updates, we need to be aware of possible conflicts with this.

NB: Those things do not matter for Dev1 booting with the same chip though.
NB: Exploit booting works with either ELF, but seems to dislike IOP reset

LaunchELF v3.41b (06/07/2005)
-Changed to a cycle like function for config loading.
-Renamed newer launch screen menu items to reflect changes to config loading.
-Added new menu, "STARTUP SETTINGS", and moved "RESET IOP" to it.

Note: Defaults are "RESET IOP: OFF", "NUMBER OF CNF'S: 1", and "KEY MAPPING: O:OK X:CANCEL".

LaunchELF v3.41a (05/30/2005)
-Added reset IOP on start as a toggle (Note: off by default).
-Added dlanor's fix for the elf launching bug.
-Changed text info from "AWAY" to "SUBTRACT" in the menus because it's more proper to say add or subtract than add or away.

Two binaries are included: BOOT.ELF - the normal binary and BOOTc.ELF - a compressed binary. The compressed binary, BOOT.ELF, was packed using pixel's ps2-packer 1.0.

The source changes to all the files that have been modified are also included. This makes it possible for the author of LaunchELF to add any or all of the current changes to the official LaunchELF project. It also helps those who may want to contribute to the uLaunchELF project. All the files that have been modified from the LaunchELF v3.41 source package are in the src folder.

Code from others was used so if anyone should get credit they should. Ideas from other people were also used, which has been helpful.

Special Thanks to the following:
Mr. Mirakichi the author of LaunchELF.
Hermes for the early reset IOP source (BOOT.c cogswaploader).
dlanor for the fix of a launch bug, which occurs upon executing an ELF after trying to execute a non-ELF file. Also for all the new additons, fixes, and help.
kthu for the key swapping source changes, which allow the user to swap x and circle buttons.
Slam-Tilt for the NETWORK SETTINGS option source changes.
chip for ps2ftpd, of which a few modifications were made to.
pixel for ps2-packer that made the small BOOTc.ELF binary.
mrbrown for the independence exploit.
The ps2dev community for the tools and assistance.
all those who like LaunchELF.
