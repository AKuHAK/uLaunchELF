Unofficial LaunchELF releases by EP + dlanor + various contributors

LaunchELF v3.74 (2006.06.05)
-Modified HddManager to make more partitions visible
-Added lots of changes to HddManager to improve speed and reliability (still slow init)
-Fixed a bug that affected creation of a partition of exactly 2048MB
-Fixed a bug that made HddManager miss subpartition sizes of 4096MB in total sum

LaunchELF v3.73 (2006.06.02)
-Added "MISC/Set CNF_Path" command that sets the CNF_Path variable by direct browsing. Note however that this does not work properly for HDD paths (yet). For those you can only use the CNF_Path variable in the "Startup Settings"
-Added "MISC/Load CNF" command that simply reloads CNF (useful with CNF_Path variable)
-Added CNF_Path variable (Startup Settings) to override normal CNF path choice
-Fixed a PathPad bug causing free space of another device to be shown for host:
-Fixed Overwrite query to show real folder names, never titles (not unique)
-Fixed a bug in usb_mass that prevented backup of MC saves using backslash in names
-Fixed a bug in HddManager that caused freezing with Sony-style protected partitions
-Raised an index limit for partition arrays from 100 to 400 for larger disk support
-Added progress messages to GetHddInfo function (mainly for debugging)
-Changed HddManager to cause partition list refresh for the FileBrowser when needed
-Changed HddManager to use configurable colours
-Added four more configurable colours to Screen Settings for GUI graphs (eg: HddManager)
-Merged HddManager contributed by Polo. It can be launched as MISC/HddManager

LaunchELF v3.72 (2006.05.24)
-Fixed a bug that sometimes caused incorrect display of free MC space
-Fixed a bug that prevented correct display of file size sums of 4GB or more
-Fixed a bug that prevented correct display of free size for HDD partitions > 4GB
-Changed various configuration menus for better consistency and appearance

LaunchELF v3.71 (2006.05.21)
-Changed browser to allow MISC/ pseudodevice for manual browsing (except 'FileBrowser')
-Changed browser to select folder created by 'New Dir' command
-Changed browser to select object preceding object(s) removed by 'Delete' command. For multiple marks the object preceding the first deleted one will become selected, and at delete failure an attempt will be made to keep selection unchanged (may fail though).
-Removed test message from triggerPowerOff function (was visible at PS2PowerOff)
-Fixed a bug that made 'Disc Control' necessary for Launch Key paths using CD

LaunchELF v3.70 (2006.05.18)
-Fixed a bug from v3.69 that messed up screen when switching CNFs or canceling CONFIG
-Changed text for ynDialog used to confirm Delete operations

LaunchELF v3.69 (2006.05.18)
-Changed MISC/PS2PowerOff function to work without either HDD or Network Adaptor
-Changed MISC/PS2Net message to "Loading NetFS and FTP Server Modules..."
-Changed Clipboard indicator to make it larger (now 14 pixels total width)
-Changed 'New Dir' command to avoid 'automatic' navigation (stay in old dir)
-Changed display of file names during Paste/mcPaste operations
-Changed ynDialog and nonDialog to preserve operational messages on screen
-Changed ynDialog to clean up screen background after completion
-Changed text for ynDialog used in query to continue/abort paste operations

LaunchELF v3.68 (2006.05.14)
-Added LED-like clipboard content indicator Red=CUT, Green=COPY (overlaps scrollbar)
-Added ability to abort Paste/mcPaste file transfers (partial dest file is removed)
-Added loadable custom key maps for the USB keyboard driver. Note that the built-in font used at present is not capable of displaying non-english characters. Some such keys may correspond to graphics characters in this font, and will then be displayed as such, while other national keys may not have any corresponding font character. Those keys will then be displayed simply as an underscore character ('_').
-Added MISC/ShowFont for reference purposes (Displays font on screen until next input)
-Added 'Show Launch Titles' to main CONFIG with CNF variable Menu_Show_Titles. When set this causes Launch Key titles to be displayed instead of ELF pathnames. The variable Menu_Hide_Paths is no longer involved in that decision, though it was earlier.
-Moved 'TIMEOUT' config to 'STARTUP SETTINGS' as it only takes effect on startup
-Corrected a bug with tooltips for configurable files
-Rearranged various font operations to allow for larger fonts (more characters) later
-Corrected bug in string drawing routines (missing test for 2byte char validity)
-Corrected bugs in char drawing routines (missing tests for font array limits)
-Corrected a usb_mass bug (false error msg for folder creation in root directory)
-Updated ps2sdk's libpad.c in external projects source package. This is the same bugfix that EP added to libpadx.c in v3.67

LaunchELF v3.67 (2006.05.13)
-Added PS2PowerOff function to MISC. Only works with PS2's that have a hard drive installed?
-Updated ps2sdk's libpadx.c in external projects source package.
-Added fixed header files to the libito external projects source package. This eliminates all the compiler warnings related to libito when building launchELF. Note: includes ito.h, itodma.h, itotypes.h, itomisc.h, itosyscalls.h, and itoimage.h.

LaunchELF v3.66 (2006.05.11)
-Added Triangle as quick exit button for all CONFIG menus, and at top level this acts the same way as the 'Cancel' command. The purpose of this is to allow you to exit and recover original settings, if you accidentally create settings that make the screen text invisible. All you need do in such a case is to press Triangle repeatedly. When you reach the main menu, all settings will have been restored.
-Added ability to complete boot without any gamepad connected. Note that you'll need a USB keyboard to use uLaunchELF without gamepad, and that this keyboard must be enabled in the CNF (also default). If you connect a gamepad after booting, then it needs to be a Sony original, or fully compatible, otherwise it may fail to work correctly.
-Added startup setting to enable (also default) or disable the USB keyboard driver. This setting uses the new CNF variable USBKBD_USED.
-Added startup setting for external keyboard driver as alternative to that built in. Note however that this is not compatible to Sony drivers, but only to those from PS2SDK. This setting uses the new CNF variable USBKBD_FILE.
-Modified browser for CNF paths, to block browsing USB to set USB drivers (can't work)
-Modified browser for CNF paths, to block browsing MISC for anything except launch keys
-Fixed a bug in the initialization of the keyboard, which made it work only if mass: had already been accessed in the boot process (either for booting, or for skin loading).
-Fixed a bug causing the wrong tooltip to be shown for Init_Delay in 'STARTUP SETTINGS'
-Fixed a bug which has prevented external USBD.IRX drivers from being used. This bug never reported any errors, but merely caused the internal driver to be used at all times. The new routine will only fall back on the internal driver if loading of the external one really fails, or if no external driver was specified.
-Fixed a bug in skin loading that caused a file handle never to be closed if a JPG file was selected with zero size, or a size for which memory allocation fails. (Not likely to happen, but still a bad bug.)

LaunchELF v3.65 (2006.05.09)
-Implemented 'Rename' for PS1 MC files (still not possible for PS2 MC)
-Merged support for USB keyboard in filename entry, contributed by Polo
-Added support for USB keyboard as alternate gamepad in uLaunchELF.
NB: See separate file "keyboard.txt" for additional details.

LaunchELF v3.64 (2006.05.08)
-Fixed some bugs in launch key title management.

LaunchELF v3.63 (2006.05.07)
-Implemented user defined launch key titles for use in the main menu, in place of the ELF names. Such titles can be edited in the main CONFIG menu, but doing so is completely optional. The file name will be used (as previously) if no title is defined for an entry. Titles will only be displayed if the option "HIDE FULL ELF PATHS" is set ON in the CONFIG menu. Otherwise the full ELF path is shown (that setting replaces the old entry "PRINT ONLY FILENAME"). Titles will be saved to the CNF file in the form "LK_xxxx_Title", where xxxx is some button designation (eg: "Circle", "Square", etc. By editing the CNF directly you can also define some titles that are not accessible in CONFIG. These are LK_Select_Title, LK_Left_Title, and LK_Right_Title, and those titles will then be used for the corresponding entries in the main menu, even though these are not really launch keys. Note that the current virtual keyboard places a 33 char limit on these titles. This limit will be extended later. All other parts of the implementation allows for 70 characters.
-Modified timeout halting, so that timeout will continue even if a button is pressed, if that button lacks any defined purpose in uLaunchELF. This is intended to allow button commands to mod chips without affecting the timeout of uLaunchELF.
-Added configurable init delay, so that button commands to mod chips can be used in the starting of uLaunchELF, and yet allow the user time to release those keys before uLaunchELF starts responding to any buttons. If a default program has been defined, its timeout delay will not start until the init delay has completed. You can control the new delay through the new CNF variable Init_Delay, which has a default value of zero. This new delay method also replaces the one used for emergency booting, as introduced in v3.62, but using a default delay of two seconds for that boot method (since no CNF is expected then).
-Dropped the 'emergency' CNF inhibit feature introduced in last version, as it interferes with compatibility to other launchers. (Partly some gamepad driver issue.)

LaunchELF v3.62 (2006.05.06)
-Improved free space calculation, to make it work correctly for PS1 memory cards
-Changed browser display to show final slash for all links to directories, which was not done previously for ".." or for gamesave titles.
-Added support for PS1 gamesave titles, both as separately copied gamesave files, and in the standard form produced by the built-in PS2 browser (save file in folder of same name). You can easily tell the difference from the fact that folders always have a slash at the end of the string, even in title mode.
-Reimplemented string cursor blinking for virtual keyboard
-Added support for both keypads, in parallel. Use both or either one, with no need for the other to be connected.
-Added emergency CNF inhibit. Pressing 'Select' button during startup will prevent the normal loading of "LAUNCHELF.CNF". This can be used either to load an "EMERGENCY.CNF" file holding user-defined defaults, or to fall back on the built-in defaults (simply by not having any "EMERGENCY.CNF" file). When the emergency button is used there will be an extra 2 second delay from program init until button commands are accepted, to allow the user time to release the 'Select' button (so it is not misinterpreted as a normal command).

LaunchELF v3.61 (2006.04.18)
-Added PathPad array for user defined browser shortcuts which can be accessed in browser by pressing R2 to bring up the PathPad submenu. Though not strictly a CNF variable, since it doesn't really configure anything, this array is saved at the end of each CNF file, so the paths can be reused in future sessions. (The main purpose of this is to minimize repetitive manual browsing) NB: There is no separate save command for this feature, so you must enter the CONFIG menu and then exit it with 'OK', to resave a CNF with PathPad.
-Modified some menus for consistent use of Triangle button
-Modified MISC/PS2Browser to make it go directly to that browser (as before v3.50)
-Slightly modified CD init for MISC/PS2Disc launching (eliminated a rare error case)

LaunchELF v3.60  (2006.04.11)
-Split the background colour usage into one colour used by libito/GS for pixels outside of the normal screen area, and another used inside the normal screen area. The former will now always be max black (value 0) while the latter will remain as used previously. This change eliminates the inconsistent colouring of screen borders, making them consistently black from now on. 
-Added configurable option for opaque popup menus to the 'SCREEN SETTINGS' submenu.
-Fixed a bug in loadSkin function, that prevented skins from being loaded from HDD folders using long path strings (as for deeply nestled folders or very long names). That bug may have caused other errors too, depending on path strings used
-Fixed a cosmetic bug that affected top right corner of menu frame in filebrowser, when using simple colour setup instead of JPG skin.

LaunchELF v3.59  (2006.04.04)
-Modified 'CONFIG' so that 'CANCEL' restores original skin state
-Modified 'SCREEN SETTINGS' so that 'DEFAULT SCREEN SETTINGS' turns off skin
-Modified main menu so that 'LOAD CONFIG++' and 'LOAD CONFIG--' will update all screen settings correctly. This was already done for skin, but not for screen offset and interlace.
-Fixed a bug that made v3.58 use wrong default value for vertical screen offset

LaunchELF v3.58  (2006.04.04)
-dlanor: Fixed a bug that could corrupt a Launch Key setting, if you started to browse for a new ELF of a launch key whose old ELF was on MC, and then cancelled out of the browser
-dlanor: Tweaked some display parameters to improve visibility of characters at the 'edges' of the screen. Mainly needed for top and bottom lines (esp corner characters)
-dlanor: Readjusted some display parameters so that file browser now uses 26 rows for PAL, and 22 rows for NTSC.
-dlanor: Modified the methods of handling display parameters, to make it easier to modify screen layouts
-dlanor: Corrected various implementation bugs of the new resolution for NTSC
-dlanor: Added support for either PAL or NTSC TV modes on either PAL or NTSC consoles. The TV mode is configurable in 'STARTUP SETTINGS', and requires reset of the console to activate a changed mode
-dlanor: Renamed the "SKIN SETTING" submenu to "SKIN SETTINGS" as it has two settings now
-Polo35: Reimplemented much of the graphics routines, to provide new higher resolutions of 640x512 for PAL consoles and 640x448 for NTSC consoles
-Polo35: Added brightness control for skins. This allows skin pictures to be used that would not work otherwise because they contain both bright and dark areas, so that text would become invisible on parts of the background. By adjusting skin brightness you can ensure text readability with any picture. Brightness is configurable in 'SKIN SETTINGS' submenu

LaunchELF v3.57  (2006.04.02)
-Fixed a bug that interfered with timeout for default ELF launching

LaunchELF v3.56  (2006.04.02)
-Added CONFIG option 'Menu Frame:'. Default is ON, stored in CNF as "Menu_Frame = 1"
-Modified all menus/submenus to minimize redundant display calls (offload GS). The purpose of this change is mainly to reduce the risk of screen flicker, but another side effect is that the program may be more responsive, as it no longer wastes time on unneded work
-Fixed a skin problem by adding 'itoGsFinish()' calls after skin texture load calls

LaunchELF v3.55  (2006.03.30)
-dlanor: Rearranged colour configuration in 'SCREEN SETTINGS' to make more room
-dlanor: Moved menu title configuration to 'SCREEN SETTINGS'
-dlanor: Added colour patches and descriptive labels to colour configuration
-dlanor: Changed colour configuration format to hex, so as to match CNF file
-Polo35: Moved skin configuration to 'SCREEN SETTINGS'
-Polo35: Added JPG skin preview

LaunchELF v3.54  (2006.03.29)
-Removed limitation that prevented use of JPG skins stored on HDD
-Improved readability of source code by adding a new drawSprite function

LaunchELF v3.53  (2006.03.28)
-dlanor: Added user editable menu title (individual per menu page)
-Polo35: Sealed some memory leaks in the JPG background skin implementation.
-Polo35: Improved vertical resolution of JPG skin by 87.5% (240/128)

LaunchELF v3.52  (2006.03.26)
-Merged in JPG background implementation, contributed by 'Polo35' at PS2-Scene.
-Combined hdd patches to a single IRX for both PS2 and PStwo, eliminating the need for model-dependent ELFs. Now all models of PS2 and PStwo can use the same ELFs.
-Modified the partition 'hiding' of both the main program and the FTP server, so as to allow normal file/folder access to the partition "__common", used by the Sony HDD browser for memory card backups.
-Modified the timeout method so that pressing any gamepad keys will permanently halt the timeout. The timeout will also be halted once the DEFAULT action has been performed. This is useful for those who set up "MISC/PS2Net" as DEFAULT action, to start FTP server.
-Modified menu handling, to prevent all file/folder write access to the pseudo-folder of "host:/" which is equivalent to the "elflist.txt" file on the host system (normally your PC). Such access is meaningless, but the commands were not blocked previously.

LaunchELF v3.51  (2006.03.03)
-Added experimental support for HDD on 'slim PStwo' models, released as separate ELFs in the same release ZIP. Developers should be aware that this patch adds a new module to PS2SDK, named "ps2hdd_slim_PStwo.irx" and serving the same purpose for those models that "ps2hdd.irx" does for traditional PS2 models. Thanks go to 'lonwern' at PS2-Scene for pointing out the precise function in the source code that needed patching.

LaunchELF v3.50  (2006.03.01)
-Modified the ELF loader so it can reside at the same address used in LaunchELF versions earlier than v3.46, and still retain compatibility with current version of PS2Link. This eliminates the incompatibility that v3.46-v3.49 had with some unpacker stubs, and thus with all programs using those stubs, (notably myPS2). Full compatibility is now restored for those programs.

LaunchELF v3.49  (2006.02.26)
-EP Fixed an issue where garbage could be displayed at startup when LaunchELF was booted by another program's generic launcher function. (Note: Issue only appeared to occur randomly with the packed ELF when using only one CNF).

LaunchELF v3.48  (2006.02.25)
-EP corrected a bug in the reading of free size on MC. This bug could cause menu commands to fail with extremely slow MC. (Noted with 64MB MCs from Datel.) Thanks go to 'cmal1492' for bringing this bug to our attention. (It is older than the uLaunchELF project.)

LaunchELF v3.47  (2006.02.22)
-Corrected a serious bug in the IOP Reset routine (reverse logic for SifIopSync).

LaunchELF v3.46  (2006.02.20)
-Modified the ELF loader of LaunchELF to improve compatibility with PS2Link. This resulted in slightly smaller code, and as a side effect the loader will no longer display the name of the ELF to be loaded on screen. The major benefit is that LaunchELF will work well with the new version of PS2Link, also released this night. Thanks go to Drakonite for his advice on how to improve this compatibility.

LaunchELF v3.45  (2006.02.19)
-Fixed a LaunchELF bug that prevented folder overwrites when pasting to HOST.
-Fixed a PS2Client bug that prevented detection of folder conflicts on HOST.
-Added a progress report (written file bytes counter) to 'Paste' and 'mcPaste'.
-EP fixed a few issues that prevented PS1 memory cards from appearing in FTP listing. (Note: Files on PS1 memory cards lack timestamps so the timestamps come from the current PS2 system time).

LaunchELF v3.44  (2006.02.18)
-Implemented HOST interface write access to networked PC. This uses a new CNF variable named "NET_HOSTwrite" which has a default value of "0" meaning it is disabled. For reasons of safety there is no way to change this value from the config menu. Edit it yourself, and set its value to "1" (or any other non-zero value) to enable the new abilities, which include the following menu functions 'Cut', 'Paste', 'mcPaste', 'Delete', 'Rename', 'New Dir'. Note that most of the new functions require a very recent version of ps2client or RadHostClient to function, and at present the 'Rename' function only works with the ps2client version specially patched for LaunchELF. (Available in the LaunchELF forum.) (NB: file writing seems bugged in RadHostClient v1.5)
-Added modified sources for ps2client to the folder "Changed source for external projects".

LaunchELF v3.43  (2006.02.16)
-This release is purely a bugfix for an old bug in the HOST interface. That bug was mostly harmless in older versions, but became capable of freezing the console in v3.41u and v3.42.

LaunchELF v3.42  (2006.02.15) NB: switched date format to YYYY.MM.DD
-Implemented mcPaste command in submenu. Like the old Paste command this copies all selected files and folders (recursively), but it is specially intended for MC backups. It can only be used either to copy from MC to non-MC (making backups from MC) or to copy from non-MC to MC (restoring backups to MC). These backups on non-MC media will have an extra file in each folder, holding the original MC attributes and timestamps of all files in that folder. This data will be used when restoring the backups to MC, so that games will accept the restored files as being the originals. The 'extra' files are filtered out from such copying so they don't appear among the restored files on MC. Those 'extra' files all use the same filename, which is "PS2_MC_Backup_Attributes.BUP.bin" (to avoid any confusion with 'real' files).

LaunchELF v3.41u (02/13/2006)
-Implemented new standards for handling of file and folder attributes on PS2 memory cards. This ensures that all gamesaves copied from one such MC to another such MC will have all attributes and timestamps preserved, so the copies remain acceptable to the games. It also improves the chances of successful backup/restore of gamesaves to/from non-MC devices, by using standard attributes for files and folders that match what the majority of games use.
-Implemented a patch to the 'Get Size' command, so that it will display real attributes and modification timestamp of a file/folder on MC. For non MC this will show a standard attribute and zeroed timestamp, so that's not very useful. This patch is just a temporary thing, until we make something better.
-Implemented selection of external USBD.IRX files, for those that have trouble using the one embedded into LaunchELF. (This change was contributed by 'sincro'.)

LaunchELF v3.41t (02/03/2006)
-Implemented a new CNF format and various new defaults for the settings. Essentially this means that all settings are specified as named variables, and line order is no longer significant. This will allow easy human editing as well as many new features in the future. For details on new defaults, study the enclosed LAUNCHELF.CNF

LaunchELF v3.41s (01/13/2006)
-Modified a comment in fat_write.c to fix an IOP 3.2.2 compiler issue for the usb mass driver.
-Added a new line to the end of imports.lst to eliminate an IOP 3.2.2 compiler warning for host.
-Rebuilt everything with the IOP 3.2.2 compiler. (Note: includes cdvd, ps2ftpd, and usb_mass modules).
-Modified the makefile to use the ps2dev9.irx module from the PS2SDK instead of the older one from the original LaunchELF source package. (Note: Are there still reliability problems?)
-Updated "Development related issues.txt" removing both the ps2dev9.irx reliability issue that now appears fine and the ps2ftpd.irx issue that is now fixed.
ps2ftpd new additions and changes: Included ps2ftpd.irx and source changes.
-Fixed a bug with the IOP 3.2.2 compiler by moving "int iOpened = 0" variable declaration in function FileSystem_OpenFile to the top with the other variable declarations. (Note: this fixes the crashing issue that occurred when transferring a new file to the memory card).
-Rewrote some of the auto-mount partitions code to also work with the IOP 3.2.2 compiler.
-Updated issues.txt removing the issue with the IOP 3.2.2 compiler.
-Altered files: draw.c=version_id, fat_write.c=comment fix, imports.lst=IOP warning fix, makefile=use sdk's ps2dev9 module, FileSystem.c=ps2ftpd changes

LaunchELF v3.41r (12/25/2005)
ps2ftpd new additions and changes: Included ps2ftpd.irx and source changes.
-Fixed an issue with auto-mounting hdd partitions for those using Internet Explorer as their ftp client.
-Altered files: draw.c=version_id, FileSystem.c=ps2ftpd changes

LaunchELF v3.41q (12/24/2005)
-Updated host and all its source files with EEUG's changes to fix a possible issue with host.
-Made a couple of changes to radad's latest changes to hdd_fio.c in the ps2sdk. (Note: Included hdd_fio.c, which compiles with the older iop-2.8.1 and gives accurate sizes for hdd partitions).
ps2ftpd new additions and changes: Included ps2ftpd.irx and source changes.
-Changed hdd partitions to show up as directories instead of files.
-Added the ability to auto-mount hdd partitions to pfs/0. (Notes: Once a partition's directory is opened, the partition is auto-mounted to pfs/0. The directory is then also changed to pfs/0. Partitions are un-mounted at hdd/0 and also just prior to being auto-mounted).
-Cleaned up the source code a bit to fix an unused variable compiler warning.
-Finished the UNIX-style LIST format after many other changes were made. (Note: Now the LIST format does either "MMM DD  YYYY" or "MMM DD hh:mm" based on the days between calculation).
-Made some slight changes to read the ps2's system clock.
-Added the ability to read the ps2's system clock so now root and device dirs use this instead of "1/1/1970".
-Added a days between dates calculator in order to complete the UNIX-style LIST format. (Note: Now if the modified date of a file/dir is within the last 182 days the "hh:mm" format will appear in place of the "YYYY" format as it's suppose to).
-Commented out all the extra debug printf's as they are currently no longer needed.
-Added a new uitoa function that can deal with larger sizes.
-Fixed an issue with size so now hdd partitions and files can accurately display size in bytes.
-Added issues.txt that lists the only issues left to be resolved with ps2ftpd.
-Altered files: draw.c=version_id, hostlink.h + imports.lst + irx_imports.h + Makefile + net_fio.c + net_fio.h + net_fsys.c + ps2host.c + Rules.make=updated host source files also now diff compatible, FileSystem.c + FileSystem.h + FtpClient.c + imports.lst + irx_imports.h=ps2ftpd changes

LaunchELF v3.41p (11/19/2005)
-Updated "Development related issues.txt" removing the iomanX.irx issue as it has now been fixed at the sdk level.
-Updated the source package removing iomanX things as radad's changes made it into the ps2sdk.
-Updated the makefile to use the iomanX.irx from the sdk.
-Updated the rest of dlanor's ps2sdk source files so they're more diff compatible.
-Updated the source package that fixes an inconsistency with created files/dirs hour timestamp for hdd and usb mass devices.
-Changed usb_mass driver slightly to allow the reading of Date/Time Created, Date Accessed, and Date/Time Modified.
ps2ftpd new additions and changes: Included ps2ftpd.irx and source changes.
-Reverted back to the UNIX-style LIST format as it appears to be the most compatible overall.
-Placed printf's in the driver to show timestamps and other attributes for possible future debugging purposes that will hopefully only be temporary.
-Altered files: draw.c=version_id, fat.h + fat_driver.c=support for reading more of usb mass timestamp attributes, fat_write.c + misc.c + misc.c=fixes for hour timestamp issue, makefile + libmc.h + libpad.c + libpad.h + libpad.h + libpadx.c=updates, FileSystem.c + FtpClient.c + FtpCommands.c=ps2ftpd changes

LaunchELF v3.41O (11/13/2005)
ps2ftpd new additions and changes: Included ps2ftpd.irx and source changes.
-Fixed a bug with MS-style list format and many ftp clients.
-Changed MS-style list format slightly to show 12:00AM instead of 00:00AM, which was wrong earlier. (Note: some ftp clients will get this wrong and show 12:00PM instead so be aware).
-Altered files: draw.c=version_id, FtpClient.c + FtpCommands.c=ps2ftpd changes

LaunchELF v3.41o (11/12/2005)
-Updated iomanX.irx module and source file with radad's changes.
-Updated "Development related issues.txt" updating an issue that radad found a fix for.
ps2ftpd new additions and changes: Included ps2ftpd.irx and source changes.
-Changed to MS-style LIST format for testing. More compatible?
-Made slight changes to the previously used UNIX-style LIST format.
-Added the possibility to change within the included sources the option for going back to the UNIX-style LIST format.
-Altered files: iomanX.c=radad's changes, draw.c=version_id, FtpClient.c=ps2ftpd changes

LaunchELF v3.41n (10/30/2005)
-Changed order of loading device drivers when starting ps2net. 
-Updated Slam-Tilts "NETWORK SETTINGS" with dlanor's added change to hopefully fix an issue some were experiencing.
-Updated ps2sdk's libmc.c, with dlanor's prior changes, to the source package.
-Updated "Development related issues.txt" removing an issue that has now been resolved.
ps2ftpd new additions and changes: Included ps2ftpd.irx and source changes.
-Fixed attributes of newly created files/dirs on hdd that matches LaunchELF's implementation.
-Made a workaround for "ps2fs: Warning: NULL buffer returned" issue that occurred when writing files to the hdd.
-Changed list string format slightly to match a known ftp list format as it was only off by two.
-Made the necessary changes for rename to be implemented.
-Added the ability to rename files/folders for mounted hdd partitons.
-Altered files: main.c=minor changes, config.c=ipStringToOctet changes, draw.c=version_id, libmc.c=updated, FileSystem.c + FileSystem.h + FtpClient.c + FtpClient.h + FtpCommands.c=ps2ftpd changes

LaunchELF v3.41m (10/16/2005)
usb_mass new additions and changes:
-Updated usb_mass driver to version 0.32 along with radad's change to fat_driver.c.
-Added the ability of reading of day, month, and year from variable "mtime".
-Added the ability of reading of hours, minutes, and seconds from variable "mtime".
-Fixed a bug that caused a corrupt month timestamp with newly created files in fat_write.c
ps2ftpd new additions and changes: Included ps2ftpd.irx and source changes.
-Added "hdd" as a supported filesystem device so it shows up with "mc", "pfs", and "mass" in the root device listing.
-Changed a few things to support HDD partition viewing by fixing a sub directory issue.
-Made changes to only show the same partitions that unofficial LaunchELF shows.
-Fixed issue where mc save folders, that are copy protected, showed up as files instead of folders.
-Fixed protection attributes not showing up properly with mass.
-Removed workaround for "mass" and timestamp issues since it's no longer needed do to changes to usb_mass driver.
-Altered files: fat_driver.c=usb_mass changes, fat_write.c=usb_mass month fix, FileSystem.c=ps2ftpd changes, draw.c=version_id

LaunchELF v3.41l (09/18/2005)
-Added a modified makefile for loader to the source package that was forgotten early on.
-Added "Development related issues.txt" file to the source package.
-Added Slam-Tilts "NETWORK SETTINGS" option that allows the user to edit the IPCONFIG.DAT file at mc0:/SYS-CONF.
-Renamed a few things such as menus and menu messages.
ps2ftpd new additions and changes: Included ps2ftpd.irx and source changes.
-Added a fix for multiple mc directories bug, which occurs when both slots contain PS2 memory cards.
-Added "mass" as a supported filesystem device so it shows up with "mc" and "pfs" in the root device listing.
-Changed a few things in order to accommodate support for USB mass fixing a sub directory issue.
-Created a workaround to fix a "mass" listing issue do to timestamps not being able to be accessed. (Note: Hopefully this is only temporary but as of now all files/folders timestamps for "mass" show up as "1/1/1970").
-Altered files: config.c/launchelf.h=Network Settings option, main.c=load usb device driver when launching ps2net, draw.c=version_id

LaunchELF v3.41k (08/16/2005)
-Fixed bug that prevented zero-sized files from being pasted
-Altered files: filer.c=Bugfix, draw.c=version_id
-Matrix Infinity Dev.2 boot will require the non-packed ELF

LaunchELF v3.41j (07/20/2005)
-Fixed LIBCDVD 1.15 issue with DVD-ROMs: Thanks to Neme for the explanation and solution.

LaunchELF v3.41i (07/03/2005)
-Fixed issue with ps2ftpd root directory listing bug with other ftp clients.
-Included ps2ftpd.irx compile with source changes.

LaunchELF v3.41h (06/21/2005)
-Replaced usb_mass driver with latest version, for support of more devices

LaunchELF v3.41g (06/20/2005)
-Added config name to another failure message (missed it for 'save config' earlier).
-Corrected a malloc size error (Reported by 'slartibartfast' at ps2-scene)
-Recompiled all components (including ps2sdk) using v2.8.1 of the IOP compiler

LaunchELF v3.41f (06/18/2005)
-Added config name to both failure messages (Name of config that failed to load/save).
-Replaced ps2ftpd module to eliminate a problem with memory card transfers.
NB: Matrix Infinity Dev.2 boot again works with either of the ELFs.

LaunchELF v3.41e (06/17/2005)
-Changed ps2dev9.irx module from present PS2SDK to an older version, to achieve much
 improved reliability for the host: interface. All other functionality is unchanged.
NB: Matrix Infinity Dev.2 boot again requires the non-packed ELF for this version.

LaunchELF v3.41d (06/17/2005)
-Fixed bug from v3.41c, causing IOP reset to fail in some cicumstances
 This was fixed by not using initsbv_patches before IOP reset.
 For future updates, we need to be aware of possible conflicts with this.
-Fixed bug from v3.41c, causing Net Config values to not be displayed.
NB: Matrix Infinity Dev.2 boot works for either ELF, with or without IOP reset
NB: Matrix Infinity Dev.1 boot works for either ELF, with or without IOP reset
NB: Exploit boot works with either ELF, with or without IOP reset

LaunchELF v3.41c (06/15/2005)
-Added key config MISC/PS2NET which starts FTP server and PS2NetFS
-Added 'host:' device with ability to browse PC filesystems (ps2client at PC end).
-Added alternate sort order when showing titles: L1=sort_by_title, L2=sort_by_folder
-Added IOP module checker to avoid many module conflicts
-Added experimental PS2SDK functions to allow IOP reset with MCMAN functionality
-Added alternate iomanX module to improve HDD access reliability
-Tweaked and twisted various stuff to improve operation in general
NB: Matrix Infinity Dev2 booting requires the non-packed ELF, and IOP reset OFF in CNF
NB: Those things do not matter for Dev1 booting with the same chip though.
NB: Exploit booting works with either ELF, but seems to dislike IOP reset

LaunchELF v3.41b (06/07/2005)
-Changed to a cycle like function for config loading.
-Renamed newer launch screen menu items to reflect changes to config loading.
-Added new menu, "STARTUP SETTINGS", and moved "RESET IOP" to it.
-Added "NUMBER OF CNF's" to "STARTUP SETTINGS". (NOTE: Sets the max number of config files).
-Added kthu's "KEY MAPPING" to "STARTUP SETTINGS". (NOTE: Sets the X:OK and O:CANCEL).
-Added dlanor's many fixes including memory leak fix for loadConfig, reset IOP bug, memory card access issue, and config loading problems with compressed ELF's.

Note: Defaults are "RESET IOP: OFF", "NUMBER OF CNF'S: 1", and "KEY MAPPING: O:OK X:CANCEL".

LaunchELF v3.41a (05/30/2005)
-Added reset IOP on start as a toggle (Note: off by default).
-Added dlanor's fix for the elf launching bug.
-Changed text info from "AWAY" to "SUBTRACT" in the menus because it's more proper to say add or subtract than add or away.
-Changed text for setting "INIT" to "INITIAL SCREEN SETTINGS".
-Added support for two total configs press d-pad left or right to switch between configs. (Note: the two configs are LAUNCHELF.CNF and LAUNCHELF1.CNF).
-Added two menus below the Select config item - left and right to load configs via menu.

Two binaries are included: BOOT.ELF - the normal binary and BOOTc.ELF - a compressed binary. The compressed binary, BOOT.ELF, was packed using pixel's ps2-packer 1.0.

The source changes to all the files that have been modified are also included. This makes it possible for the author of LaunchELF to add any or all of the current changes to the official LaunchELF project. It also helps those who may want to contribute to the uLaunchELF project. All the files that have been modified from the LaunchELF v3.41 source package are in the src folder.

Code from others was used so if anyone should get credit they should. Ideas from other people were also used, which has been helpful.

Special Thanks to the following:
