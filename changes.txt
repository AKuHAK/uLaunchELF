Unofficial LaunchELF by EP + dlanor

LaunchELF v3.41m
usb_mass new additions and changes:
-Updated usb_mass driver to version 0.32 along with radad's change to fat_driver.c.
-Added the ability of reading of day, month, and year from variable "mtime".
-Added the ability of reading of hours, minutes, and seconds from variable "mtime".
-Fixed a bug that caused a corrupt month timestamp with newly created files in fat_write.c
ps2ftpd new additions and changes: Included ps2ftpd.irx and source changes.
-Added "hdd" as a supported filesystem device so it shows up with "mc", "pfs", and "mass" in the root device listing.
-Changed a few things to support HDD partition viewing by fixing a sub directory issue.
-Made changes to only show the same partitions that unofficial LaunchELF shows.
-Fixed issue where mc save folders, that are copy protected, showed up as files instead of folders.
-Fixed protection attributes not showing up properly with mass.
-Removed workaround for "mass" and timestamp issues since it's no longer needed do to changes to usb_mass driver.
-Altered files: fat_driver.c=usb_mass changes, fat_write.c=usb_mass month fix, FileSystem.c=ftpd changes, draw.c=version_id

LaunchELF v3.41l
-Added a modified makefile for loader to the source package that was forgotten early on.
-Added "Development related issues.txt" file to the source package.
-Added Slam-Tilts "NETWORK SETTINGS" option that allows the user to edit the IPCONFIG.DAT file at mc0:/SYS-CONF.
-Renamed a few things such as menus and menu messages.
ps2ftpd new additions and changes: Included ps2ftpd.irx and source changes.
-Added a fix for multiple mc directories bug, which occurs when both slots contain PS2 memory cards.
-Added "mass" as a supported filesystem device so it shows up with "mc" and "pfs" in the root device listing.
-Changed a few things in order to accommodate support for USB mass fixing a sub directory issue.
-Created a workaround to fix a "mass" listing issue do to timestamps not being able to be accessed. (Note: Hopefully this is only temporary but as of now all files/folders timestamps for "mass" show up as "1/1/1970").
-Altered files: config.c/launchelf.h=Network Settings option, main.c=load usb device driver when launching ps2net, draw.c=version_id

LaunchELF v3.41k
-Fixed bug that prevented zero-sized files from being pasted
-Altered files: filer.c=Bugfix, draw.c=version_id
-Matrix Infinity Dev.2 boot will require the non-packed ELF

LaunchELF v3.41j
-Fixed LIBCDVD 1.15 issue with DVD-ROMs: Thanks to Neme for the explanation and solution.

LaunchELF v3.41i
-Fixed issue with ps2ftpd root directory listing bug with other ftp clients.
-Included ps2ftpd.irx compile with source changes.

LaunchELF v3.41h
-Replaced usb_mass driver with latest version, for support of more devices

LaunchELF v3.41g
-Added config name to another failure message (missed it for 'save config' earlier).
-Corrected a malloc size error (Reported by 'slartibartfast' at ps2-scene)
-Recompiled all components (including ps2sdk) using v2.8.1 of the IOP compiler

LaunchELF v3.41f
-Added config name to both failure messages (Name of config that failed to load/save).
-Replaced ps2ftpd module to eliminate a problem with memory card transfers.
NB: Matrix Infinity Dev.2 boot again works with either of the ELFs.

LaunchELF v3.41e
-Changed ps2dev9.irx module from present PS2SDK to an older version, to achieve much
 improved reliability for the host: interface. All other functionality is unchanged.
NB: Matrix Infinity Dev.2 boot again requires the non-packed ELF for this version.

LaunchELF v3.41d
-Fixed bug from v3.41c, causing IOP reset to fail in some cicumstances
 This was fixed by not using initsbv_patches before IOP reset.
 For future updates, we need to be aware of possible conflicts with this.
-Fixed bug from v3.41c, causing Net Config values to not be displayed.
NB: Matrix Infinity Dev.2 boot works for either ELF, with or without IOP reset
NB: Matrix Infinity Dev.1 boot works for either ELF, with or without IOP reset
NB: Exploit boot works with either ELF, with or without IOP reset

LaunchELF v3.41c
-Added key config MISC/PS2NET which starts FTP server and PS2NetFS
-Added 'host:' device with ability to browse PC filesystems (ps2client at PC end).
-Added alternate sort order when showing titles: L1=sort_by_title, L2=sort_by_folder
-Added IOP module checker to avoid many module conflicts
-Added experimental PS2SDK functions to allow IOP reset with MCMAN functionality
-Added alternate iomanX module to improve HDD access reliability
-Tweaked and twisted various stuff to improve operation in general
NB: Matrix Infinity Dev2 booting requires the non-packed ELF, and IOP reset OFF in CNF
NB: Those things do not matter for Dev1 booting with the same chip though.
NB: Exploit booting works with either ELF, but seems to dislike IOP reset

LaunchELF v3.41b
-Changed to a cycle like function for config loading.
-Renamed newer launch screen menu items to reflect changes to config loading.
-Added new menu, "STARTUP SETTINGS", and moved "RESET IOP" to it.
-Added "NUMBER OF CNF's" to "STARTUP SETTINGS". (NOTE: Sets the max number of config files).
-Added kthu's "KEY MAPPING" to "STARTUP SETTINGS". (NOTE: Sets the X:OK and O:CANCEL).
-Added dlanor's many fixes including memory leak fix for loadConfig, reset IOP bug, memory card access issue, and config loading problems with compressed ELF's.

Note: Defaults are "RESET IOP: OFF", "NUMBER OF CNF'S: 1", and "KEY MAPPING: O:OK X:CANCEL".

LaunchELF v3.41a
-Added reset IOP on start as a toggle (Note: off by default).
-Added dlanor's fix for the elf launching bug.
-Changed text info from "AWAY" to "SUBTRACT" in the menus because it's more proper to say add or subtract than add or away.
-Changed text for setting "INIT" to "INITIAL SCREEN SETTINGS".
-Added support for two total configs press d-pad left or right to switch between configs. (Note: the two configs are LAUNCHELF.CNF and LAUNCHELF1.CNF).
-Added two menus below the Select config item - left and right to load configs via menu.

I have included two binaries: BOOT.ELF - the normal binary and BOOTc.ELF - a compressed binary. The compressed binary, BOOT.ELF, was packed using pixel's ps2-packer 0.4.5.

I release my changes to parts of the source in the hopes that the author of LaunchELF may add some or all of my modifications. I have included all the files that I made changes to in the src folder. Also diff's are included as well in the src\diff folder just apply against the source of v3.41 or just use my already modified src files.

I used some other peoples code so if anyone should get credit they should. I also used some other people's ideas, which I'm thankful for.

Special Thanks to the following:
Mr. Mirakich the author of LaunchELF?
Hermes for reset IOP (BOOT.c cogswaploader)
dlanor for the fix of a launch bug, which occurs upon executing an ELF after trying to execute a non-ELF file. Also for all the new fixes.
kthu for the key swapping source changes, which allow the user to swap x and circle buttons.
Slam-Tilt for the NETWORK SETTINGS option source changes.
pixel for ps2-packer that made the small BOOTc.ELF
all those who like LaunchELF
